# Quantity Measurement App

## UC1 - Compare Two Lengths in Feet

### Objective
To verify equality of two length values measured in feet.

### Problem Statement
Given two length values in feet, check whether they are equal.

### Implementation
- Created a `Feet` class
- Stored length value as `double`
- Overridden `equals()` method to compare values
- Written JUnit test cases

### Concepts Used
- OOP
- Encapsulation
- Method Overriding
- Unit Testing

### Outcome
Successfully compared two length objects based on value instead of reference.

## UC2 - Compare Length in Feet and Inches

### Objective
To verify equality between length values measured in different units (Feet and Inches).

### Problem Statement
Given two length values where:
- One value is in Feet
- One value is in Inches

The system should correctly determine whether both represent the same physical length.

### Implementation
- Created an `Inches` class
- Stored length value as `double`
- Implemented logic to convert inches to feet (or vice versa) for comparison
- Used overridden `equals()` method for value-based comparison
- Written JUnit test cases for cross-unit validation

### Concepts Used
- OOP
- Encapsulation
- Unit Conversion
- Method Overriding
- Floating Point Comparison
- Unit Testing

### Outcome
Successfully implemented comparison between different measurement units by introducing unit conversion logic.

## UC3 - Generic Quantity Class for DRY Principle

### Objective
To refactor the existing design by introducing a Generic Quantity class in order to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Problem Statement
In previous use cases, separate classes (Feet, Inches) contained similar comparison and conversion logic, leading to code duplication.

The goal of UC3 is to:
- Remove repetitive logic
- Introduce a reusable and generic `Quantity` class
- Centralize comparison logic

### Implementation
- Created a generic `Quantity` class
- Stored value and unit inside the same class
- Implemented common comparison logic in one place
- Eliminated duplicate conversion logic from individual unit classes
- Updated test cases to use the generic class

### Concepts Used
- DRY Principle
- Refactoring
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Code Reusability
- Object-Oriented Design

### Outcome
Successfully reduced code duplication by introducing a single reusable `Quantity` class.  
Improved maintainability and scalability of the system.
